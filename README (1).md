# Insertion
 
 Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration
 
* Example : int [] arrayLIst = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]; 
* Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 4 (last element of the array)
* i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12 
  [11, 12, 13, 5, 6]
* i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements are smaller than 13 
  [11, 12, 13, 5, 6]
* i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position. 
  [5, 11, 12, 13, 6]
* i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position. 
  [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
